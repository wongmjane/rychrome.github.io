<h2>Confusion to what Computer Science <i>actually</i> is.</h2>

<p>It's 2017, society consistently demands constant technological innovation and advancement. How could Computer Science not be relevant in a public school curriculum? An example of this can be easily identified in children. The time spent with on screen media drastically increases from the toddler to preschool to school-age years. Children under two have an average screen time of 53 minutes per day. This increases to almost two and a half hours per day among two to four year olds and almost three hours for kids in the five to eight year old range-and it's only growing. Children born today are brought into a world where technology is deeply fabricated in the routine of everyday life, just like mathematics and other sciecnes, Computer Science has become an integral part of the things we do each day. Increasing the understanding of Computer Science at earlier stages of education will only allow for the advancement of society at an exponential rate.</p>
	
<h2>Comptuer Science is an integrated part of our lives, so why don't educators teach Computer Science before College?</h2>
	<p> The question was asked on popular website <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-isnt-computer-science-taught-in-schools">Quora</a> where <a href=https://www.quora.com/profile/Till-H%C3%A4nisch>Till Hanisch</a>, a Computer Science professor, claims that the reason Computer Science hasn't been integrated into the school system is mainly due to the study of Computer Science being widely confused by the general population with the act of Coding. Many higher ups in K-12 school administrations are turned off to Computer Science because they figure why not just leave it to the nerds to make our stuff, or they don't understand the subject at a deeper surface.</p>

<h2>So what's the solution? How can we fix this problem?</h2>
	<p> One way to introduce Computer Science in grades K-12, is to not introduce it to school board officials with the title "Computer Science", but instead introduce it with the name "Computational Thinking." Some say that by doing this it creates a higher interest by immediately creating a connection that the course invokes the student to be involved in a deep thought process in order to solve problems and algorithms. This is good for both students and people trying to push for Computer Science for all ages because it allows for the stress that Computer Science is more than just computing, while also introducing Computer Science into pre-collegiate grade levels. </p>

<h2> Diversity. </h2>
	<p> If you were to ask a random individual what they think a Software Enginner looked like, it would probably be parallel to the same description they would give you if you were to ask them what they think a nerd looks like. This is a <i>huge</i> problem for the field as it singles out numerous groups of people who may be interested, and even extremly gifted in Computer Science. By introducing Computer Science as a curriculum course in pre-collegiate level classrooms, you therefore expose people who can help further technology and society at a quicker rate-which is extremly important.</p>
	<p> But the need for diversity when discussing interest in Computer Science doesn't just stop at age; there's an urgent demand for Women, Blacks, and Hispanics in Computer fields as well. A report by <a href="http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/diversity-gaps-in-computer-science-report.pdf">Google</a> delves deeper into this topic. <i>Black (58%) and Hispanic (50%) students are less likely than White students (68%) to use a computer at home at least most days of the week. This could influence their confidence in learning CS because, as this study finds, students who use computers less at home are less confident in their ability to learn CS.</i> the report finds.</i> "Female students are less likely than male students to be aware of CS learning opportunities on the Internet and in their community, to say they have ever learned CS, and to say they are very interested in learning CS. Despite presumably equal access to CS learning opportunities in schools, female students are not only less aware but also less likely than male students who have learned CS to say they learned it online (31% vs. 44%) or on their own outside of a class or program (41% vs. 54%). Female students are also less interested (16% vs. 34%) and less confident they could learn CS (48% vs. 65%). The lesser awareness, exposure, interest, and confidence could be keeping female students from considering learning CS." </i> </p>

<h2> #CSforAll.</h2>
 <p> <a href="http://www.csforall.org/">CSforAll</a> is an organization that rovides a central resource for people interested in Computer Science (CS) education to find providers, schools, funders, and researchers focused on the goal of providing quality CS education to every child in the U.S. CSforAll is currently 419 members strong and has brought attention to 30 states/territories represented by education agencies.</p>
 <p> According to website <a href="http://www.code.org">code.org,</a> 90% of parents want their child to study Computer Science. With only 40% of schools with grades K-12 teaching Computer Science, this is hard to reach, and for some is just a dream until College. Computing jobs are the #1 source of new wages in the United States with over 500,000 current openings and are expected to grow at nearly 2 times the rate of all other job fields. Computer Science needs people in the field, and students are willing to play;<i>so why not push for the advancement of Computer Science and the advancement of our society?</i></p>
