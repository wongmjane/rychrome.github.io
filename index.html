  <h1><center>Ryan Dils' website.</center></h1>
<p>Welcome to my website. My name's Ryan Dils, I'm 18 years old and currently live in Buffalo, NY. I attend the University at Buffalo and am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. However, if I could be one thing in the world, it would be a model-so expect a good amount of pictures of myself on here lol. My other hobbies include: coding, reading, fashion, going to the gym and lifting weights, playing tennis, and occasionally playing video games with my friends.</p>

    <h1>Music preferences</h1>
    <p>I pretty much listen to all types of music-except country music-that's one genre that my ears just can't tolerate. My favorite artists at the moment are Drake, Sade, Justin Bieber, Enrique Iglesias, Justin Timberlake, and Jorja Smith just to give you a brief idea. But don't be fooled, even though these artists are more on the pop/rnb/dance-hall side of the music industry, even I went through an emo phase in High School and even still listen to Heavy Metal and Hard Rock from time to time-especially at the gym.
      
      I love exercise. It clears the mind. Without it I think that I would go crazy. I recently picked up tennis and that's something a year ago I couldn't imagine myself doing. Tennis is a great sport; you don't have to rely on a someone that isn't you who has the ability to lose the game for the whole team. When you play Tennis, it's just you that you have to worry about, I think that's what I like about it. Tennis is a hell of a work out too, having to sprint quickly while thinking of different strategies on where to try and get the ball to land on the otherside of the net is something I find fascinating. I like to think of it as fast paced chess in a way.
