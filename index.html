	<p> Sure, coding is a huge part of Computer Science, but that's not all there is to it. Board members of education across the world are quick to abolish the idea of implementing Computer Scienece into their curriculum due to a false idea of what the course <i>actually</i> is. Computer Science, is defined as the practical approach to computation and its applications and the study of it and it's applications. In other words, the study of Computers <i>Who would've guessed?</i>

	  <p>It's 2017, society consistently demands constant technological innovation and advancement. How could Computer Science not be relevant in a public school curriculum. An example of this can be easily identified in children. The time spent with on screen media drastically increases from the toddler to preschool to school-age years. Children under two have a screen time average of 53 minutes per day. This increases to almost two and a half hours per day among two to four year olds and almost three hours for kids in the five to eight year old range-and it's only growing. Children born today are brought into a world where technology is deeply fabricated in the routine of everyday life, just like mathematics and other sciecnes, Computer Science has become an integral part of the things we do each day. Increasing the understanding of Computer Science at earlier stages of education will only allow for the advancement of society at an exponential rate.</p>
