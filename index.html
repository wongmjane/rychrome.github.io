  <h1><center>Ryan Dils</center></h1>
<p>Welcome to my website. My name's Ryan Dils, I'm 18 years old and currently live in Buffalo, NY. I attend the University at Buffalo and am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. However, if I could be one thing in the world, it would be a model-so expect a good amount of pictures of myself on here lol. My other hobbies include: coding, reading, fashion, going to the gym and lifting weights, playing tennis, occasionally playing video games.</p>
